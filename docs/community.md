Containerlab openness and focus on multivendor labs was a key to its success and adoption. With more than a dozen Network Operating Systems spread across several networking vendors and opensource teams, it is a tool that can answer the needs of a broad network engineers community.

## Discord Server
Growing the number of supported NOSes is a task that can't be done by a single person, and there the community role is adamant. To support and cherish the growing containerlab community and provide better feedback and discussions platform, we launched containerlab's own Discord server.

Everybody is welcome to join and chat with our community members about all things containerlab!

## In The Media
We are always happy to showcase containerlab and demonstrate its powers. Luckily, the network engineering community has lots of events worldwide, and we participated in some. Below you will find recordings of containerlab talks in different formats and on various venues listed in reverse chronological order[^1].

### Containerlab - running networking labs with Docker UX
<small>:material-youtube: Screencast · [NANOG 83](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qigCla1qY3k) · :material-calendar: 2021-11-03</small>

Our very first NANOG appearance and we went full-steam there. This talk is the most comprehensive containerlab tutorial captured to that date. It starts with the basics and escalates to the [advanced DC fabric deployment](https://youtu.be/qigCla1qY3k?t=2131) with HA telemetry cluster created. All driven by a single containerlab topology file.

### Containerlab - a Modern way to Deploy Networking Topologies for Labs, CI, and Testing
<small>:material-youtube: Screencast · [Open Networking & Edge Summit 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snQTlFahY1c) · :material-calendar: 2021-10-11</small>

This 30mins screencast introduces containerlab by going through a multivendor lab example consisting of Nokia SR Linux, Arista cEOS, and GoBGP containers participating in a route reflection scenario.

The talk starts with the reasoning as to why containerlab development was warranted and what features of container-based labs we wanted to have. Then we start building the lab step by step, explaining how the containerlab topology file is structured.
