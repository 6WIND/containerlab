Containerlab openness and focus on multivendor labs was a key to its success and adoption. With more than a dozen Network Operating Systems spread across several networking vendors and opensource teams it became a tool that can answer the needs of a wide network engineers community.

Growing the number of supported NOSes is a task that can't be done by a single person, and there the community role is adamant. To support and cherish the growing containerlab community and provide a better feedback and discussions platform we launched a containerlab's own Discord server.

Everybody is welcome to join and chat to our community members about all things containerlab!
