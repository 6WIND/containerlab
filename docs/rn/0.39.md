## Partial configs for SR OS

Containerlab now supports partial configs for SR OS. This means you can now provide CLI snippets that will be added to the default config. A very useful feature when you want to add a few things to the config, and you don't want to copy the whole config to your lab. #1249

We believe this will make your lab repos cleaner and easier to maintain.

=== "Topology"
    ```yaml
    name: sros_lab
    topology:
      nodes:
        sros:
          kind: vr-sros
          startup-config: myconfig.partial.txt
    ```
=== "`myconfig.partial.txt`"
    ```
    configure {
        router "Base" {
            static-routes {
                route 192.168.200.200/32 route-type unicast {
                    next-hop "192.168.0.1" {
                        admin-state enable
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Node filtering

One of the most requested features is finally there. Users wanted to be able to deploy only a subset of nodes defined in their topology file. Usually, this was driven by the need to control the resource usage of the lab and optimize the deployment time.

Containerlab now allows users to provide a list of nodes to deploy, destroy, save, and graph commands to scope the operation to only those nodes. #1298

Check out [Node Filtering docs](../manual/node-filtering.md) for details.

## RARE joins Containerlab

We are happy to announce that [RARE](../manual/kinds/rare-freertr.md) Network OS is now supported by Containerlab. RARE stands for Router for Academia, Research & Education.

## Securely connecting to labs with Border0 (experimental)

With mysocketio rebranding to border0 we had to revisit APIs for creating secured remote access to labs. This is an experimental feature and is not yet fully supported. Please see [this](../manual/published-ports.md) page for more details. #1131
