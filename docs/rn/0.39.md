## Partial configs for SR OS

Containerlab now supports partial configs for SR OS. This means that you can now specify only the parts of the config that you want to change, and the rest will be taken from the default config. This is a very useful feature when you want to change only a few things in the config, and you don't want to copy the whole config to your lab. #1249

Learn more about partial configs for SR OS [here](../manual/kinds/vr-sros.md#user-defined-config).

## Node filtering

This has been one of the most requested features for a long time. Users wanted to be able to deploy only a subset of nodes defined in their topology file. Usually, this was driven by the need to control the resource usage of the lab and and optimize the deployment time.

Containerlab now allows users to provide a list of nodes to deploy, destroy, save, and graph commands to scope the operation to only those nodes. #1298

Check out [Node Filtering docs](../manual/node-filtering.md) for details.

## Securely connecting to labs with Border0 (experimental)

With mysocketio rebranding to border0 we had to revisit APIs for creating secured remote access to labs. This is an experimental feature and is not yet fully supported. Please see [this](../manual/published-ports.md) page for more details. #1131
